This repository contains some basic examples of using Vala and GTK+ 3. Each example tries to showcase some use of the widget in an easy-to-understand form.

A tutorial to further explain the use of each widget may be written in the future, possibly when GTK+ 4 is released.

Before running the examples, you will need to install the Vala compiler. The examples can then be run using:

  valac <filename.vala> --pkg gtk+-3.0
